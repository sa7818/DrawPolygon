# DrawPolygon
Draw Polygon in Java

This program will work with Midpoint line drawing Algorithm and scan conversion Algorithm
The button for Line Only will work with midpoint algorithm and draw pixels on the edge of the polygon 
The button for Fill Only will fill the polygon based on the scan conversion algorithm
The last button is the combination of first two buttons which works with all polygon that User provide such as:
Correct scan conversion for convex polygons 
Correct scan conversion for concave polygons 
Correct scan conversion for self-intersecting polygons
